These two labs demonstrate two aspects of using Fabric Real-Time Intelligence with the Power Platform. 

Lab 1 demonstrates using Reflex to Monitor, Detect and Act on incoming real-time signals.
With this lab, the BikePoint signal sample data is monitored for exceptions on the BikePoints capacity values. When the capacity is either too high or too low, a reflex triggers a Power Automate flow.

Lab 2 demonstrates reporting on live, real-time data in combination with data from Dynamics/Dataverse.
With this lab, You'll use a system-wide dashboard that displays live, real-time data about the state of the Bike Points in London.
The second report will be imbedded into the Case form to display live data in the context of a service request.

In the meantime - the gist is to import the excel file with the BikePoints (as accounts) - Then follow the labs.
