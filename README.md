## Files are located in the London Bike Example folder

## Pre-requisite
 - Import the excel file with the BikePoints (as accounts) 
 - Follow the labs in the PDF

## Labs
These two labs demonstrate two aspects of using Fabric Real-Time Intelligence with the Power Platform. 

### Lab 1: Using Reflex to Monitor, Detect and Act on incoming real-time signals.
With this lab, the BikePoint signal sample data is monitored for exceptions on the BikePoints capacity values. When the capacity is either too high or too low, a reflex triggers a Power Automate flow.

### Lab 2: Reporting on live, real-time data 
With this lab, You'll use a system-wide dashboard that displays live, real-time data about the state of the Bike Points in London. The second report will be imbedded into the Case form to display live data in the context of a service request.
